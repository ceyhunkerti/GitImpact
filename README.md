Image Manipulation Detection
=========

Code for Universal Image Manipulation Detection, adapted from [A Deep Learning Approach to Universal Image Manipulation Detection Using a New Convolutional Layer](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2930786), using Caffe. 

This work has been done during a last year project in Ecole Centrale de Lille (engineering school) under the surpervision of Patrick Bas (CNRS Lille, CRISTAL) and John Klein (CNRS Lille, CRISTAL).
